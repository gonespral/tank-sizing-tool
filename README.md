    Universal Tank Sizing Tool
</h1>

## About the Tool
The Universal Tank Sizing Tool is a comprehensive Python-based engineering solution designed to automate the preliminary design and sizing of the **Stratos V rocket propellant tanks**. Acting as a critical bridge between system requirements and detailed design, this software enables:

- **Rapid Generation** of tank configurations based on system inputs.
- **Validation and Optimization** of tank geometries to meet engineering constraints.
- Efficient design processes **prior to Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** and prototype testing, saving significant time and resources.

This tool is instrumental in early-stage engineering workflows, providing engineers with accurate and optimized tank designs that align with project requirements.

## Key Features
- **Geometry Optimization**: Find the best dimensions for the tank to meet weight, volume, and structural constraints.
- **System Requirement Integration**: Automatically adapt designs to given constraints and input parameters.
- **Rapid Prototyping Assistance**: Deliver precise outputs to guide detailed analysis and manufacturing.
